OSX:
IOSSIOSPEED?

FreeBSD:
 /dev/cuaU0
Looks good. Port setup is actually simpler than Linux because the termios
struct takes the nonstandard baud rate directly. No ioctl() is required.

OpenBSD:
 /dev/cuaU0
Apparent problem with termios, specifically with the VTIME parameter. When
the ECU is connected and powered on, everything works fine, but when the
ECU doesn't respond, the read() call blocks forever instead of timing out
after VTIME*0.1s.

NetBSD:
 /dev/ttyU0 - blocks on open(), probably not correct
 /dev/ctyU0 - blocks on open(), probably not correct
 /dev/dtyU0 - opens fine, but still problems with tcsetattr()
Seems the uftdi driver is busted (with respect to the baud rate selection.)
Even though the FTDI chip is capable of arbitrary baud rates, the driver
returns EINVAL (from tcsetattr()) if any nonstandard rate is passed in.
Of course, this prevents the system from setting up the port correctly.
